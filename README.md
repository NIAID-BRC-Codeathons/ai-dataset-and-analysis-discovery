# AI-Powered Analysis Pathfinder: From Research Questions to Data and Workflows

Enabling bench scientists to start with analysis goals and receive both relevant datasets and executable workflows—a complete path from question to execution.

## About This Project

This is a project from the **NIAID BRC AI Codeathon 2025**, taking place November 12-14, 2025 at Argonne National Laboratory.
